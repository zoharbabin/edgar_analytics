"""
custom_strategy_example.py

Demonstrates creating and using a custom ForecastStrategy subclass,
showing how you can intelligently tailor revenue forecasts beyond
the default ARIMA approach.

Below we define a CustomYoYStrategy that:
 - Calculates an average year-over-year (YoY) growth rate
   based on historical data in rev_dict.
 - Applies that average growth to the last known data point
   to predict the next periodâ€™s revenue.

We then pass this strategy to 'forecast_revenue' to see
how it yields a custom forecast.

You can adapt this approach for seasonal logic, additional factors,
machine-learning models, or any specialized forecasting method.
